# ol3-extras-demos

Demos for playing with OpenLayers 3 when features not documented because not required in the core

* [KMZ demo](https://rawgit.com/webgeodatavore/ol3-extras-demos/master/kmz/demo-kmz.html) 
  **Warning**: The demo depends from alerts provided by NOAA National Weather Service at their Storm prediction center, so display can be empty but you can always look at the console)
  The demo uses two libraries e.g [zip.js](https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/) for unzipping KMZ and [Qwest](https://github.com/pyrsmk/qwest),  an "Ajax library with XHR2, promises and request limit"

* [TSV demo](https://rawgit.com/webgeodatavore/ol3-extras-demos/master/tsv/demo-tsv.html)
  The demo loads a TSV (Tab-separated Values) file and transforms it to GeoJSON using [csv2geojson](https://github.com/mapbox/csv2geojson) as GeoJSON is supported within OpenLayers 3.
